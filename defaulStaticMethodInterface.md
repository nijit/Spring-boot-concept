Yes, in Java, starting with **Java 8**, interfaces can have both **default methods** and **static methods**. This was introduced to allow more flexibility in evolving interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility.

Here’s a quick explanation of both:

### 1. **Default Methods in Interfaces**
A **default method** is a method in an interface that has a body (implementation) and can be overridden by classes that implement the interface. This allows interfaces to evolve without breaking the existing code that implements them.

#### Key Points:
- A default method provides a default behavior for implementing classes.
- Classes that implement the interface can either use the default method or override it.
- Default methods are defined using the `default` keyword.

#### Example:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("Default Method in Interface");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // No need to override the 'show' method, but it can be if needed
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Output: Default Method in Interface
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyClass` implements `MyInterface`, but doesn't need to override the `show()` method since it has a default implementation.

### 2. **Static Methods in Interfaces**
A **static method** in an interface is a method that belongs to the interface itself and not to the instances of the classes that implement the interface. This means it can be called without creating an instance of the implementing class.

#### Key Points:
- Static methods in interfaces are similar to static methods in classes.
- They belong to the interface itself and are not inherited by the implementing classes.
- Static methods are called using the interface name.

#### Example:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static Method in Interface");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface.staticMethod();  // Output: Static Method in Interface
    }
}
```

Here, the static method `staticMethod()` belongs to the `MyInterface` interface and is called directly using the interface name.

### Why Were These Introduced?
- **Default methods**: To allow interface evolution. If a new method is added to an interface, existing classes that implement it won’t break because a default implementation is provided.
  
- **Static methods**: To allow utility methods to be part of the interface itself, rather than having to be placed in separate utility classes.

### Important Points to Remember:
- **Default methods** can be overridden by implementing classes.
- **Static methods** cannot be overridden and belong only to the interface.
- **Interfaces cannot have instance fields**; they can only have constants (i.e., `public static final` variables).

By allowing default and static methods, Java 8 made interfaces more powerful and flexible without losing the advantages of abstraction.
